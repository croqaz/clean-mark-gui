**This tool is in alpha stage**

Convert an article into a clean Markdown text file.

## Why ?

1. Sometimes, you read an interesting article and after a while, you can't find it anymore. (in this case, bookmarks can help too)
1. Sometimes, the article you read is deleted by the author.
1. Sometimes, the website is down, or it disappears completely.

This tool can extract the content of the articles and you can have it available offline.
It is similar with tools like: Pocket, Readability, or Instapaper, but the article is not saved in the cloud, you can use it locally.

## Note

Use this tool responsible.
When you're not visiting the blog that contains the articles you love, you're killing its traffic; if you're not viewing its ads, you're killing its potential income.
Don't be that guy. Don't kill the websites that you love.
